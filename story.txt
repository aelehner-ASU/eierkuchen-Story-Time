I drove my Porsche to the Biergarten a few towns over, but when I got there they were all out of beer!
The hund hoped into the BMW and played Rammstein while riding down to the Flughafen.
Once I got to Flughafen I topped at the local Baeckerei and bought us both a Apfelkuchen.
While my hund and I ate our apfelkuchen, I decided to stop and grab some brawurst and a loaf of Brut at the local grocer.
